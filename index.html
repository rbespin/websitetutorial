	<p>Go to your preferred text editor (i like sublime for front end), and code up your website. Make sure that every file relevant to the website is in a localized directory. </p>

	<p>Below is a screenshot of my terminal commands. The commands were `cd desktop` (change the working directory to the desktop), `mkdir websitetutorial`, which makes a directory called websitetutorial (directory = folder) on your desktop. This is where everything for the website will be located. `pwd` prints the current working directory that you are located in (this is super important). For everything git, you want to be in the proper directory. `ls` lists the files located in websitetutorial. In websitetutorial, there are various pictures, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, a file named "index.html". Having the main html page named index.html lets GitHub know that it should create a gitpage for your website. </p>

	<p>after you are finished coding your website(I'm just using a basic html page for this tutorial), refer back to the previous repository page that came up after creating the repository on github. </p>
